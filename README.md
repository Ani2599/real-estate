# Real Estate Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a comprehensive Machine Learning project tailored for real estate applications. The project is divided into three core components:

1. **Price Predictor**: A machine learning model that predicts property prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities.
2. **Analysis App**: An interactive app that offers in-depth analysis and visualizations of real estate data, providing valuable insights.
3. **Recommend Apartments**: An intelligent recommendation engine that suggests apartments based on user preferences and requirements.

## Files

- `1_Price Predictor.py`: Price prediction model.
- `2_Analysis app.py`: Analysis and visualization tool for real estate data.
- `3_Recommend Apartments.py`: Recommendation engine for suggesting apartments.
